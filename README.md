# Metacrafters Projects
Projects that Metacrafters have assigned in the Blockchain course. 
## Description

This repository contains the assignments that are made during the learning process. All the projects of this repository are related to the Blockchain written in Solidity and JavaScript programming language. I have provided the quick link for the projects with the name same as the course name:

* [Javascript_Beginners.js](https://github.com/21bcs10985/Matacrafts/blob/main/NFTs.js)

In this assignment, my task is store the different types of NFTs at a particular place and also keep the count of it. So to fullfill the requirements i have created an array and then store all the NFTs into it by taking the input through a function. 
This assignment requires the basic knowledge of arrays and functions. 



* [ETH_Beginners.sol](https://github.com/21bcs10985/Matacrafts/blob/main/ETH_Proof.sol)

In this assignment i have to create a smart contract whose working is same as the banking that is deposite and withdraw. To perform this we must have the basic knowledge of Solidity(functions, variables, mapping etc.). 

To create this smart contract i have first mapped a address to store an integer and then create two function one will add the amount to provided address and other to withdrawl amount from the given address.
